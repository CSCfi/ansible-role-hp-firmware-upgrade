ansible-role-hp-firmware-upgrade
=========

Ansible role to upgrade HP system firmwares.

For HPE Gen10 firmwares, you will need create a list of host or group variables for the
firmware packages you wish upgrade. Compared to gen8 and gen9 upgrade tasks, now it is administrator responsibity to find suitable firmwares to the maintained servers. 

At [HPE Support Center](https://support.hpe.com/connect/s/?language=en_US) you can search for latest available firmwares to your server model and by running 
```
dnf search <packagetoupgrade.rpm>
```

you will find latest available version in your configured repositories (assuming you have configured HP repositories).


Example firmware_list variable for a HPE Apollo 4200 server. It may be advisable to keep listed firmwares commented unless you are really going to update them.

```
firmware_list:
#  - { upgrade_target: 'ILO 5', hp_repository: fwpp, firmware: firmware-ilo5, extra: "", upgrade: false, local_installation: false, local_file: "", reboot: false }
  - { upgrade_target: 'BIOS', hp_repository: fwpp, firmware: firmware-system-u39, extra: "", upgrade: true, local_installation: false, local_file: "", reboot: true }
#  - { upgrade_target: 'HPE Smart Array P816i-a SR Gen10', hp_repository: fwpp, firmware: firmware-smartarray-f7c07bdbbd, extra: "", upgrade: false, local_installation: false, local_file: "", reboot: true }
#  - { upgrade_target: 'HPE 14TB 12G SAS HDD', hp_repository: fwpp, firmware: firmware-hdd-cf0b6cabe1, extra: "", upgrade: false, local_installation: false, local_file: "", reboot: false }
